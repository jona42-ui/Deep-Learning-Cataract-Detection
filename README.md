# Deep Learning-Based Cataract Detection System

## Description
This project aims to develop a deep learning-based system for automated cataract detection in eye images. The system leverages advanced machine learning algorithms And CNN models to accurately identify the presence and severity of cataracts, enabling early diagnosis and treatment.

## Project structure
 - **data/**: Directory to store raw and processed datasets, as well as trained models.
- **mobile_app/**: Directory containing the mobile application code.
    - android/: Android-specific configuration and resources.
    - ios/: iOS-specific configuration and resources.
   
- **docs/**: Documentation files including project report, setup guides, etc.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and model training.
- README.md: Main project README file containing project overview, setup instructions, etc.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/GeekyYouthsInfo/Deep-Learning-Cataract-Detection.git`
2. Follow additional setup instructions in the `README.md` file.

## Usage
1. Follow on-screen instructions to upload eye images and view the detection results.
2. For detailed usage guidelines, refer to the [documentation](
https://deep-learning-cataract-detection.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Model Deployment (Cloud)
1. The trained model is deployed on mobile and  a cloud platform for scalability and accessibility.
2. Access the deployed model through the provided user facing interfaces.
3. Submit  requests with eye images  for cataract detection.
4. Receive the detection results through the interface.

## Dependencies
